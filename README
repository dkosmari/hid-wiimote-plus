What is this?
=============

This is a modification of the built-in Linux kernel module for Nintendo Wii
remotes. It's a drop-in replacement for the original module.


How is it different?
====================

1. The mapping from Wii remotes (and accessories) buttons and axes was modified
   to respect the Linux kernel conventions, and behave like gamepads, instead of
   a mixture of gamepad and keyboard. For convenience, "gamepad.rst" from the
   Linux docs is included here.

  - D-pad buttons are now mapped to BTN_DPAD_* events, instead of keyboard arrow
    keys.
  - Buttons +/Start and -/Select are now mapped to BTN_START and BTN_SELECT.
  - Face/action buttons are now mapped to east, south, north, west buttons.

2. Better battery status reporting is implemented too, to make it interact more
   nicely with desktop environments.

3. Memory allocation is done in the module's scope, so it's guaranteed to be
   released when the module unloads.

4. Accelerometer and gyro devices register proper metadata
   (INPUT_PROP_ACCELEROMETER and correct units.)

5. Sticks (Nunchuk and Classic Controller) don't invert the Y axis anymore.
   Positive values mean "down."

6. Classic Controller Pro no longer reports analog shoulder buttons (L/R), only
   the Classic Controller (not Pro) has them. Range for analog shoulder buttons
   has been corrected from [-30,+30] to [0,+60].

7. Balance Board reports its sensors as HAT0X, HAT1X, HAT2X, HAT3X; that is,
   four 1-D axes instead of two 2-D axes.


How to compile?
===============

You'll need the kernel development headers in your system.

Use the commands:

    make
    sudo make install

This will rename the original module, adding a ".backup" extension, to disable
it from loading.

To uninstall, use:

    sudo make uninstall


If you just want to test it, without installing it, use these commands instead:

    make
    sudo rmmod hid-wiimote
    sudo insmod ./hid-wiimote.ko
